# SPMM: Structure-Property Multi-Modal learning for molecules

The official GitHub for SPMM, a multi-modal molecular pre-trained model for a synergistic comprehension of molecular structure and properties.
The details can be found in the following paper: 
*Bidirectional Generation of Structure and Properties Through a Single Molecular Foundation Model. ([Nature Communications 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46440-3))*

Molecule structure will be given in SMILES, and we used 53 simple chemical properties to build a property vector(PV) of a molecule.

## Files
* `data/`: Contains the data used for the experiments in the paper. (you have to make this folder and put the data that you downloaded from the link above.)
* `Pretrain/`: Contains the checkpoint of the pre-trained SPMM. (you have to make this folder and put the checkpoint that you downloaded from the link above.)
* `vocab_bpe_300.txt`: Contains the SMILES tokens for the SMILES tokenizer.
* `property_name.txt`: Contains the name of the 53 chemical properties.
* `normalize.pkl`: Contains the mean and standard deviation of the 53 chemical properties that we used for PV.
* `calc_property.py`: Contains the code to calculate the 53 chemical properties and build a PV for a given SMILES. **Modify this code accordingly to utilize SPMM pre-training for your custom PVs.**
* `SPMM_models.py`: Contains the code for the SPMM model and its pre-training codes.
* `SPMM_pretrain.py`: runs SPMM pre-training.
* `d_*.py`: Codes for the downstream tasks.

## Requirements
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages.

## Code running
Arguments can be passed with commands, or be edited manually in the running code.

1. Pre-training
    ```
    python SPMM_pretrain.py --data_path './data/pretrain.txt'
    ```

2. PV-to-SMILES generation
   * batched: The model takes PVs from the molecules in `input_file`, and generates molecules with those PVs using k-beam search. The generated molecules will be written in `generated_molecules.txt`.
       ```
       python d_pv2smiles_batched.py --checkpoint './Pretrain/checkpoint_SPMM.ckpt' --input_file './data/pubchem_1k_unseen.txt' --k 2
       ```
   * single: The model takes one query PV and generates `n_generate` molecules with that PV using k-beam search. The generated molecules will be written in `generated_molecules.txt`. Here, you need to build your input PV in the file `p2s_input.csv`. Check the four examples that we included.
       ```
       python d_pv2smiles_single.py --checkpoint './Pretrain/checkpoint_SPMM.ckpt' --n_generate 1000 --stochastic True --k 2
       ```

3. SMILES-to-PV generation
    
    The model takes the query molecules in `input_file`, and generates their PV.

    ```
    python d_smiles2pv.py --checkpoint './Pretrain/checkpoint_SPMM.ckpt' --input_file './data/pubchem_1k_unseen.txt'
    ```

4. MoleculeNet + DILI prediction task

    `d_regression.py`, `d_classification.py`, and `d_classification_multilabel.py`, perform regression, binary classification, and multi-label classification tasks, respectively.

    ```
    python d_regression.py --checkpoint './Pretrain/checkpoint_SPMM.ckpt' --name 'bace'
    python d_classification.py --checkpoint './Pretrain/checkpoint_SPMM.ckpt' --name 'bbbp'
    python d_classification_multilabel.py --checkpoint './Pretrain/checkpoint_SPMM.ckpt' --name 'clintox'
    ```

5. Forward/retro-reaction prediction tasks

    `d_rxn_prediction.py` performs both forward/reverse reaction prediction tasks on USPTO-480k and USPTO-50k datasets.

    e.g. forward reaction prediction, no beam search
    ```
    python d_rxn_prediction.py --checkpoint './Pretrain/checkpoint_SPMM.ckpt' --mode 'forward' --n_beam 1 
    ```
    e.g. retro reaction prediction, beam search with k=3
    ```
    python d_rxn_prediction.py --checkpoint './Pretrain/checkpoint_SPMM.ckpt' --mode 'retro' --n_beam 3 
    ```
